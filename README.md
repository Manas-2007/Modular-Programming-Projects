# Modular Programming Projects (C++)

This repository contains multiple C++ projects built using modular programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.  
Each project is structured using header files (.h) and implementation files (.cpp) to maintain clean and organized code.

## Projects Included
- Bank Management System (OOP based)
- Menu-driven console applications
- Input validation based programs
- Modular structured C++ mini projects

## Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Functions and Modular Programming
- Header and Source file separation
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Menu-driven systems
- Input validation techniques

## Purpose
This repository is created to practice real-world C++ programming and strengthen problem-solving skills using modular and object-oriented approaches.

More projects will be added regularly.
